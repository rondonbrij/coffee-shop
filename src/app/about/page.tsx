          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Founded in 2023 by a group of passionate food and sustainability
            advocates, Earthy Vibes started as a small caf√© in Puerto Princesa,
            where we focused on offering fresh, wholesome, and sustainable food
            and drinks. Our commitment to quality and sustainability quickly
            gained us a loyal following, allowing us to expand our reach and
            impact.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Today, we source ingredients from eco-conscious farms and producers,
            carefully crafting them into the wholesome products we offer to
            customers who share our values.

                &quot;I&apos;m thrilled to share the journey of how I became the
                proud owner of Earthy Vibes Cafe. It all started with a passion
                for specialty cafe and a dream to create a cozy, eco-friendly
                haven where community and sustainability thrive. After years of
                perfecting my craft as a barista and cafe roaster, I took the
                leap and invested in a small cafe shop. Through hard work,
                dedication, and a commitment to sourcing high-quality,
                environmentally responsible beans, Earthy Vibes Cafe quickly
                gained a loyal following. As the business grew, so did my
                vision. I expanded operations, introduced innovative brewing
                methods, and fostered meaningful relationships with local
                artisans and suppliers. Today, Earthy Vibes Cafe is a beloved
                gathering place, serving as a testament to the power of passion,
                perseverance, and a genuine love for the art of cafe.&quot;
